  **Angular-xeditable** is a bundle of [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) directives that allows you to create
  *editable* elements in your projects.  
  Such technique is also known as *click-to-edit* or *edit-in-place*.  
  It is based on ideas of [x-editable](http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable) but was written from scratch
  to use power of angular and support complex forms / editable grids.

  Basically it does not depend on any libraries except [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) itself.    
  For themes you may need to include [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) CSS.  
  For some extra controls (e.g. datepicker) you may need to include [angular-ui bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/).
