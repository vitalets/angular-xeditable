# Angular-xeditable
Edit in place for AnguarJS

## Overview
**Angular-xeditable** is a bundle of [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) directives that allows you to create
*editable* elements in your projects.  
Such technique is also known as *click-to-edit* or *edit-in-place*.  
It is based on ideas of [x-editable](http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable) but was written from scratch
to use power of angular and support complex forms / editable grids.
